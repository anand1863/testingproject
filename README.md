# testingproject

In this project I performed smoke testing of the build. I wrote 5 test cases and wrote script to execute those test cases using Selenium webdriver. Login, Signup, Deposit money, withdraw money and transfer money functionalities of the Bank website were tested.

•	The Tests were executed at once in TestNG framework using a test.xml file which were used to generate HTML test report of the test.

•	Surefire plugin was used to generate a detailed report to the passed/failed tests.

• project was a  maven build. Maven download all the dependencies 

•	The test scripts were written for chrome browser but can work well with other browser with minor changes in the script
