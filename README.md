# testingproject

In this project I performed smoke testing of the build. I wrote 5 test cases and wrote script to execute those test cases in Selenium. 
Login, Signup, Deposit money, withdraw money and transfer money functionalities of the Bank website were tested.
The Tests were executed at once in TestNG framework using a test.xml file. 
Surefire plugin was used to generate a detailed report to the passed/failed tests. 
The project is made in maven.
The test scripts were written for chrome browser but can work well with other browser with minor changes in the script.
